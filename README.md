# CNN-Digit-Recognizer

This project implements a high-performance Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the Kaggle "Digit Recognizer" competition. The goal is to predict which digit (0-9) a handwritten number represents. To achieve the highest accuracy, we implemented a custom deep and wide CNN architecture using Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras.

To push the boundaries of standard architectures this proyect is the result of a rigorous hyperparameter tuning and the implementation of advanced techniques such as Data Augmentation, Cosine Decay Learning Rate Scheduler, Swish activation function, K-Fold Cross Validation, Test Time Augmentation (TTA), and Ensemble Learning. All of this was done to achieve the highest possible accuracy on the test set, placing it in the Top 3% of the Kaggle leaderboard with a final prediction accuracy of 99.7%.

Even knowing that the final result is really good, the project can still be improved by adding more advanced techniques, although given the limited scope for improvement, the effort involved may not entirely justify the increase in accuracy.
